# A C# Programme to Rename, Swap Suffix to be Prefix
### Loop through Folders to get File names and rename the Files C#

### My Goal was to solve a problem with the lynda.com tutorials being downloaded by the youtube-dl python script with the video id being attached at the end as a suffix. 
#### e.g "Create and manage user accounts-481529.mp4" to be "481529-Create and manage user accounts.mp4" Then i SORT by Name in a PC.
